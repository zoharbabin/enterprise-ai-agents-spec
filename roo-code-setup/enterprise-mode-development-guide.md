## 1. Mode Definition Framework

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope Definition

Every custom mode must clearly define its purpose, scope, and boundaries to prevent overlap and ensure focused functionality.

#### Purpose Statement Template
```markdown
## Mode Purpose Statement

**Primary Function:** [Single sentence describing the mode's main responsibility]
**Domain Expertise:** [Specific area of specialization]
**Target Users:** [Who will primarily use this mode]
**Business Value:** [How this mode contributes to organizational objectives]

**Example - Security Mode:**
- **Primary Function:** Ensure comprehensive security assessment and implementation across all enterprise systems
- **Domain Expertise:** Cybersecurity, threat assessment, compliance validation, security architecture
- **Target Users:** Security teams, compliance officers, system architects, DevOps engineers
- **Business Value:** Risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, security posture improvement
```

#### Scope Boundaries Framework
```yaml
Mode Scope Definition:
  Included_Responsibilities:
    - [List of specific tasks this mode handles]
    - [Domain-specific activities within scope]
    - [Quality standards this mode enforces]
    
  Excluded_Responsibilities:
    - [Tasks that belong to other modes]
    - [Activities outside domain expertise]
    - [Responsibilities that require different skill sets]
    
  Collaboration_Points:
    - [Where this mode interfaces with other modes]
    - [Handover protocols and dependencies]
    - [Shared responsibilities and coordination needs]
```

### 1.2 Mode Classification System

Classify modes by complexity, specialization, and enterprise integration requirements:

#### Mode Categories
```yaml
Mode Classification Framework:
  Core_Modes:
    - architect: System design and technical planning
    - code: Implementation and development
    - debug: Issue diagnosis and troubleshooting
    - orchestrator: Workflow coordination and project management
    
  Specialized_Modes:
    - security: Cybersecurity and threat assessment
    - compliance: Regulatory and audit requirements
    - performance: Optimization and benchmarking
    - data: Data governance and analytics
    
  Domain_Specific_Modes:
    - devops: Infrastructure and deployment
    - product: Product management and strategy
    - research: Analysis and investigation
    - docs: Documentation and knowledge management
    
  Enterprise_Integration_Levels:
    Basic: Standard tool integration and basic workflows
    Advanced: MCP server integration and external API coordination
    Enterprise: Full compliance, audit trails, and regulatory integration
```

## 2. Core Responsibilities Template

### 2.1 Standard Mode Structure

Every custom mode should follow this standardized responsibility structure:

#### Primary Responsibilities Framework
```markdown
## Core Mode Responsibilities

### 1. Domain Expertise
**Responsibility:** [Primary domain knowledge and skills]
**Implementation:**
- [Specific expertise areas]
- [Knowledge requirements]
- [Skill applications]

### 2. Task Execution
**Responsibility:** [How the mode executes its primary tasks]
**Implementation:**
- [Task planning and breakdown]
- [Execution methodologies]
- [Quality validation procedures]

### 3. Tool Integration
**Responsibility:** [Which tools the mode uses and how]
**Implementation:**
- [Primary tools and their usage patterns]
- [MCP server integrations]
- [External system coordination]

### 4. Quality Assurance
**Responsibility:** [Quality standards and validation procedures]
**Implementation:**
- [Quality checkpoints and gates]
- [Validation methodologies]
- [Success criteria definition]

### 5. Collaboration Protocols
**Responsibility:** [How the mode interacts with other modes and stakeholders]
**Implementation:**
- [Handover procedures]
- [Communication standards]
- [Stakeholder engagement patterns]
```

### 2.2 Mode Capability Matrix

Define capabilities across standardized dimensions:

#### Capability Assessment Framework
```yaml
Mode Capabilities Assessment:
  Technical_Complexity:
    Low: Basic configuration and simple tasks
    Medium: Moderate technical implementation
    High: Complex system design and architecture
    Expert: Advanced domain-specific expertise
    
  Stakeholder_Interaction:
    Minimal: Primarily technical execution
    Moderate: Regular stakeholder updates
    High: Extensive stakeholder collaboration
    Strategic: Executive and business stakeholder engagement
    
  Compliance_Requirements:
    Standard: Basic organizational compliance
    Enhanced: Industry-specific requirements
    Regulatory: Government and regulatory compliance
    Audit: Full audit trail and documentation requirements
    
  Integration_Complexity:
    Standalone: Independent operation
    Coordinated: Basic inter-mode collaboration
    Integrated: Complex workflow coordination
    Enterprise: Full enterprise system integration
```

## 3. Tool Integration Patterns

### 3.1 XML Tool Syntax Standards

All custom modes must use proper XML syntax for tool integration:

#### Core Tool Usage Patterns
```xml
<!-- File Operations -->
<read_file>
<args>
  <file>
    <path>relative/path/to/file.ext</path>
  </file>
</args>
</read_file>

<write_to_file>
<path>relative/path/to/file.ext</path>
<content>
