    - Best practices research for implementation guidance
    - Competitive analysis for positioning
    
  Decision Support:
    - Evidence-based recommendations
    - Current industry standards validation
    - Risk assessment with market intelligence
    - Innovation opportunity identification
    
  Continuous Learning:
    - Emerging technology monitoring
    - Industry trend analysis
    - Regulatory update tracking
    - Security threat intelligence
```

### Research Decision Matrix
```yaml
Research Approach Selection:
  Direct Research (Current Mode):
    - Tactical needs requiring immediate information (<5 min)
    - Specific technical questions with clear answers
    - Quick validation of current practices
    - Immediate decision support requirements
    
  Research Mode Delegation:
    - Strategic analysis requiring deep investigation (>5 min)
    - Complex market or competitive analysis
    - Comprehensive technology evaluation
    - Multi-source investigation and synthesis
    
  Hybrid Approach:
    - Initial direct research for immediate needs
    - Follow-up delegation for comprehensive analysis
    - Parallel research streams for complex decisions
```
