# 3) Core Principles
cat > "$TARGET_DIR/.roo/rules-core-principles/01-core-principles.md" << 'EOF'
# Core Principles

1. Use only the provided context; read other files only when absolutely needed.
2. Write clear, concise output in code blocks, Markdown, or simple lists.
3. Do not include secrets or credentials.
4. Keep each file or code snippet under 350–500 lines.
5. On any error, report the issue and suggest a fix.
6. Research tools:
   - USE for unknown APIs or security details.
   - AVOID for basic syntax or trivial errors.
7. Model selection:
   - Bedrock‑Claude‑3.7 (default)
   - Gemini‑2.5‑Pro (creative/complex one‑off)
   - OpenAI‑o4‑mini‑high (deep code analysis)
8. Dependency Tracking:
   - Log which tasks produce which files or data.
   - Before assigning a task, check inputs; if missing, schedule their producers first.
9. Confidence & Logging:
   - Every mode reports a self‑confidence (0.0–1.0).
   - Log mode, score, and discovered dependencies to `orchestrator.log`.
10. Error & Recovery:
   - If a mode fails twice on the same task, retry with Guidance.
   - After three failures on one task, pause and ask the user.

# 4) Orchestrator
cat > "$TARGET_DIR/.roo/rules-orchestrator/01-instructions.md" << 'EOF'
## Orchestrator Instructions

1. **Detect Missing Inputs**
   - Inspect the task’s required inputs.
   - If any are missing, schedule the producer first.

2. **Compute Mode Scores**
   For each specialist mode compute:
   - SuccessRate: historical pass rate
   - FitScore: task‑purpose match
   - Load: current queue length
   - ContextMatch: project alignment
   - Score = weighted sum

3. **Autonomy Threshold**
   - If top Score ≥ 0.8:
     ```
     new_task @<mode>
     ### PARENT-REF: <parent_id>
     <one-line objective>
     ```
   - Else:
     ```
     new_task @guidance
     ### PARENT-REF: <parent_id>
     "I need more information about <aspect>."
     ```

4. **Model Usage**
   - Default: Bedrock‑Claude‑3.7
   - One‑step creative: Gemini‑2.5‑Pro (then switch back)

5. **Logging & Recovery**
   After each `attempt_completion`, append to `orchestrator.log`:
   ```yaml
   task_id: ...
   mode: ...
   score: ...
   produced: [...]
   discovered_dependencies: [...]
   success: true|false
   ```
   - Fail twice → retry with Guidance
   - Fail thrice → escalate for user feedback

6. **Parallel Execution**
   - Run up to 3 independent tasks in parallel by default.
