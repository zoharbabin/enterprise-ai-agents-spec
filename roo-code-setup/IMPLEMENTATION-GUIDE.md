### 2. Framework Integration Overview

The ecosystem now includes three shared framework documents that standardize implementation across all modes:

```yaml
Shared Framework Architecture:
  Quality Gates Framework:
    - Standardized 4-phase validation system
    - Streamlined approval workflows
    - Universal quality checkpoint patterns
    
  MCP Integration Guide:
    - Google Researcher MCP server integration

```

## Shared Framework Implementation

### Quality Gates Framework Usage

#### When to Use Quality Gates
All enterprise modes implement systematic quality gates at key transition points:

1. **Planning & Requirements Validation**
2. **Design & Architecture Approval**  
3. **Implementation & Testing Validation**
4. **Deployment & Success Confirmation**

#### Implementation Pattern
```markdown
## Quality Gate Implementation

### Reference the Framework
See [Quality Gates Framework](quality-gates-framework.md) for standardized checkpoint validation procedures and approval workflows.

### Use Streamlined Patterns
<ask_followup_question>
<question>[Phase] completed with [achievements]. [Validation summary]. Proceed to [next phase]?</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest mode="[next-mode]">[Primary action with mode switch]</suggest>
<suggest>[Alternative action without mode switch]</suggest>
<suggest>[Refinement option]</suggest>
<suggest>[Stakeholder engagement option]</suggest>
</follow_up>
</ask_followup_question>
```

#### Quality Gate Customization
Each mode customizes the universal framework for specific needs:

- **Product Mode**: Business value validation and stakeholder alignment
- **Architect Mode**: Technical feasibility and enterprise standards compliance
- **Security Mode**: Threat validation and compliance verification
- **Research Mode**: Research accuracy and strategic impact validation

### MCP Integration Guide Usage

#### Research Decision Matrix
Use the decision matrix to determine the optimal research approach:

```yaml
Research Approach Selection:
  Direct Research (Current Mode):
    - Tactical needs requiring immediate information (<5 min)
    - Specific technical questions with clear answers
    - Quick validation of current practices
    - Immediate decision support requirements
    
  Research Mode Delegation:
    - Strategic analysis requiring deep investigation (>5 min)
    - Complex market or competitive analysis
    - Comprehensive technology evaluation
    - Multi-source investigation and synthesis
```

#### MCP Tool Integration Examples
