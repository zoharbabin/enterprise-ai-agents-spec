# Agentic Roo Code Setup: `setup_roo_project.sh` 🚀

_A quickstart shell script for bootstrapping an autonomous, enterprise‑grade AI‑agentic Roo Code setup_

**`setup_roo_project.sh`** is a one‑command installer that generates:

- A fully‑formed [Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/) workspace  
- A `.roomodes` file with 14 finely‑tuned agent modes  
- Directory scaffolding for specs, code, docs, tests, and more  
- Intuitive model‑selection profiles (Bedrock‑Claude‑3.7, Gemini‑2.5‑Pro, OpenAI‑o4‑mini)  
- Built‑in “dual‑testing” (cumulative & recursive) and strict file‑access rules  

---

## 🛠️ Why and How Was It Built?

1. **Vision & Spec**  
   - In December 2024 I drafted the [Enterprise AI Agents Spec](https://github.com/zoharbabin/enterprise-ai-agents-spec/blob/main/ai-agents-ent-product-dev-spec.md), outlining a meta‑orchestrator + specialized agent swarm architecture.  
   - The goal: a baseline blueprint for a fully autonomous, enterprise‑grade coding agent system that delivers production‑ready projects.  
   - Enter [Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/) (plus the rise of [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) servers and Google’s [A2A](https://github.com/google/A2A) protocol). We’re starting to get closer! But we're not quite there yet...   
   - This setup gives you a turnkey local end‑to‑end coding workflow that follows the principles in the spec. It's still early days, but a fantastic foundation.

2. **Mode‑by‑Mode Definition (*a VERY subjective* process!)**  
   - After testing various modes including many community examples (e.g. [ruv’s SPARC](https://gist.github.com/ruvnet/a206de8d484e710499398e4c39fa6299), [Roo Code Community projects](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code-Docs/blob/main/docs/community.md)).  
   - Iteratively distilled best practices: recursive‑logic testing, security checks, DevOps tasks, etc.  
   - Built the same project dozens of times, reviewing Roo’s task log alongside ChatGPT/Gemini to spot unwanted behaviors.  
   - Merged, split, and tuned modes until the flow felt reliable, fast, and token‑efficient.  
   - Finally, I asked Roo’s own Orchestrator mode to explain its modes back to me—ensuring they’re intuitive and understood.  
   - Note: this is far from scientific. We need better metrics and tooling to optimize mode definitions. Maybe one day!

3. **Shell Script Automation**  
   Once the modes felt solid, `setup_roo_project.sh` was created to automate the boilerplate:  
   - Creates a `.roo/` folder with per‑mode instruction files  
   - Generates a `.roomodes` JSON with slugs, names, roleDefinitions, file‑regex restrictions, and tool permissions  

4. **End‑to‑End Testing**  
   I ran the script on a clean dir, reloaded Roo Code in VS Code, and exercised every mode:  
   - **Orchestrator**: spec → code → tester → integrator loops  
   - **Tester**: cumulative + recursive TDD  
   - **Security Reviewer**, **DevOps**, **Monitor**, etc., all respected their file‑access rules  
   - Verified model switches (Bedrock for most tasks, Gemini for creative planning, o4‑mini for heavy coding)  
   - Confirmed minimal human prompts only at low‑confidence or multi‑failure escalation points

## 🔮 Next Steps & Future Improvements

This script is a solid milestone on the path to a swarm‑driven, enterprise‑ready agent system. Here are some collaboration ideas:

- **Dynamic Dependency Detection**  
  Let the Orchestrator infer and reorder micro‑task dependencies automatically.  

- **Visual Workflow Dashboard**  
  Generate live Mermaid or React UIs showing task graphs, agent statuses, and escalation flows.  

- **Plugin‑style Agent Extensions**  
  Add a CLI helper so users can scaffold new modes (e.g. “Accessibility Auditor” or “Data‑Science Agent”). Better integrate A2A for secure, cross‑agent calls.  

- **Advanced Recovery & Escalation**  
  Support multi‑node Orchestrator “committees” and smarter retry policies before falling back to Guidance mode.  

- **Parallel Task Coordination**  
  Today’s flow is mostly linear; true parallel orchestration remains an open challenge (even for human dev teams!).
