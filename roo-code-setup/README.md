# Agentic Roo Code Setup: `setup_roo_project.sh` üöÄ

_A quickstart shell script for bootstrapping a highly structured, stage-gated, and quality-driven AI-agentic Roo Code workspace._

**`setup_roo_project.sh`** is a one-command installer that generates a sophisticated Roo Code environment designed for autonomous, enterprise-grade development workflows. It produces:

-   A fully-formed [Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/) workspace.
-   A `.roomodes` file defining a **stage-gated workflow ("Golden Path")** with 14 specialized agent modes (including a **QA & Release Engineer**).
-   **Mandatory testing and quality gates** (unit/E2E tests, linting, coverage ‚â• 80%) enforced by the workflow at critical stages.
-   **Architectural review triggers** and gating mechanisms to ensure design consistency.
-   A **Standard Result Protocol** for structured artifact handling (`.roo/artifacts/`) and concise reporting between modes.
-   **Enhanced Autonomy** through delegation of local information gathering to a dedicated `@devops` mode.
-   **Resilience mechanisms** including Orchestrator penalties for recently failed modes and automated reverts for failed merges.
-   Directory scaffolding for rules, artifacts, specs, code, docs, etc.
-   Intuitive model-selection profiles (Bedrock-Claude-3.7, Gemini-2.5-Pro, OpenAI-o4-mini).

## üõ†Ô∏è Why and How Was It Built?

1.  **Vision & Spec**
    *   Based on the [Enterprise AI Agents Spec](https://github.com/zoharbabin/enterprise-ai-agents-spec/blob/main/ai-agents-ent-product-dev-spec.md), aiming for a blueprint for autonomous, production-ready project delivery.
    *   Leverages [Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/), [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), and concepts like agent swarms to create a practical, local end-to-end workflow reflecting those principles.

2.  **Iterative Mode Refinement**
    *   Developed through extensive testing, analysis of community examples (like SPARC), and review of agent interactions to identify failure modes and best practices.
    *   Modes were merged, split, and tuned to create a reliable, efficient flow with clear separation of concerns. Key additions include the **QA & Release Engineer** role and explicit architectural gating.

3.  **Shell Script Automation**
    *   The `setup_roo_project.sh` script automates the creation of the `.roo/` rules structure, the `.roomodes` configuration file, and the `.roo/artifacts` directory, incorporating all refined definitions and instructions.

4.  **Workflow Validation** (*How this refined setup was tested*)
    *   This setup was validated by ensuring the Orchestrator correctly sequences tasks according to the **Golden Path**, including:
        *   Mandatory `@tester-tdd` verification after code changes (unit then relevant E2E).
        *   Explicit architectural design steps (`@architect`) triggered by keywords or complexity.
        *   Comprehensive pre-merge checks by the `@qa-release-engineer` (full test suite, lint, coverage).
        *   Adherence to the **Standard Result Protocol** for outputs and digests.
        *   Correct delegation to `@devops` for local information.
    *   Escalation paths for failures and architectural needs were confirmed to function as designed.

## ‚ú® Key Features of this Setup

*   **Stage-Gated Workflow:** Uses `golden_path_stage` tags and artifact checks (`DESIGN-*.md`, Tester PASS reports) to ensure tasks execute in logical order (Research ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Quality Check ‚Üí Merge).
*   **Mandatory Quality Gates:** The `QA & Release Engineer` enforces strict, objective checks (100% tests pass, lint clean, ‚â•80% coverage) before any merge into the main branch.
*   **Architectural Oversight:** Critical tasks trigger `@architect` involvement proactively, and implementation modes (`@code`, `@debug`) halt and escalate if unforeseen design issues arise.
*   **Test-Driven Verification:** Code changes are mandatorily followed by focused testing (`@tester-tdd`) to validate functional correctness immediately.
*   **Standard Result Protocol:** Agent communication remains concise via short digests, while detailed outputs (logs, diffs, reports) are stored systematically in `.roo/artifacts/` for traceability and use by subsequent tasks.
*   **Autonomous Info Gathering:** Reduces unnecessary human prompts by empowering modes to delegate requests for local information (git status, file lists, etc.) to the `@devops` mode.
*   **Enhanced Resilience:** The Orchestrator penalizes recently failed modes, and the `QA & Release Engineer` automatically reverts merges that fail post-integration testing.

## üîÆ Next Steps & Future Improvements

This script provides a robust foundation. Collaboration ideas include:

-   **Dynamic Dependency Detection:** Smarter Orchestrator dependency inference.
-   **Visual Workflow Dashboard:** Live task graph visualization.
-   **Plugin-style Agent Extensions:** Easier scaffolding for new modes; better A2A integration.
-   **Advanced Recovery & Escalation:** More sophisticated retry/escalation policies.
-   **Parallel Task Coordination:** Optimizing concurrent task execution.

## **CHANGELOG**

### May 4, 2025
*   Updated the introductory bullet points to highlight the key refined features (stage-gating, QA & Release Engineer, mandatory testing, quality gates, architectural enforcement, Standard Result Protocol, enhanced autonomy, resilience).
*   Added a new "Key Features of this Setup" section to explicitly summarize these core improvements for clarity.
*   Rewrote the "Workflow Validation" (previously "End-to-End Testing") section to accurately describe how the *current*, more complex workflow was tested and validated, focusing on the interaction between modes and gates.
*   Minor wording tweaks for clarity and flow.
*   Updated the "Clone & Try" instructions to reflect cloning the `enterprise-ai-agents-spec` repo first, as that's where the script resides.
