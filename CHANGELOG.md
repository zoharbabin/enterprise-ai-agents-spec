- Automated testing and validation pipelines
- Multi-framework compliance support
- Performance optimization and monitoring integration
- Complete audit trail and documentation systems

## [4.1.1] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed `.roomodes.yaml` filename to `.roomodes` (without extension)
  - Roo Code expects configuration file to be named `.roomodes` without any extension
  - This was the root cause of custom modes not loading in Roo Code
  - Updated all script references and renamed template file accordingly
  - Custom modes now load correctly in Roo Code extension

### Changed
- Updated template filename from `roomodes.yaml` to `roomodes`
- Updated all script references to use correct filename
- Fixed validation and error messages to reflect correct filename

## [4.1.0] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **BREAKING**: Removed inappropriate project directory creation from enterprise_roo_setup.sh
  - No longer creates `docs/`, `src/`, `tests/`, `infrastructure/`, `security/`, `compliance/`, `performance/`, `data/` directories
  - These directories are project-specific and not part of Roo Code's specification
  - Script now only creates required Roo Code structure: `.roo/`, `.roomodes.yaml`, `.rooignore`

### Changed  
- **BREAKING**: Significantly reduced `.rooignore` restrictions for enterprise AI agent effectiveness
  - Removed exclusions for build artifacts (dist/, build/, target/, *.exe, *.dll, etc.)
  - Removed exclusions for logs and monitoring data (logs/, *.log, monitoring/, metrics/)
  - Removed exclusions for test data and coverage (test-data/, coverage/, .pytest_cache/)
  - Removed exclusions for databases and caches (*.db, *.sqlite, cache/)
  - Removed exclusions for dependencies (node_modules/, vendor/)
  - Now only excludes actual secrets and credentials (.env, *.key, secrets/, etc.)
  - Enterprise AI agents can now access all operational data needed for effective analysis

### Improved
- Updated script messaging to reflect Roo Code focus rather than generic enterprise structure
- Enhanced documentation to clarify that only Roo Code configuration is created
- Maintained all existing functionality for mode selection and template management

## [4.0.0] - 2025-07-15

### Added
- Initial release of Enterprise Roo Code Setup
- 12 specialized enterprise modes (orchestrator, architect, code, debug, devops, security, performance, product, compliance, research, docs, data)
- Automatic workflow orchestration capabilities
- Quality gates and stakeholder approval processes
- Comprehensive security framework
- Local and remote template support
- Interactive mode selection
- Comprehensive validation and error handling
